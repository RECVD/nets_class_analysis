# nets_class_analysis

This repo is for the analysis of pre-defined business cateogies and their change longitudinally based on the NETS (National Establishment
Time Series) data.  Include code to:

* Create H5 subsets needed for analysis
* Graph patterns of business counts over time
* Examine how patterns apply to individual states
* Look specifically into the decline in number of stores defined as supermarkets over time
